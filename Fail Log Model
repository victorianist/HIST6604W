@shawngraham has an example of a fail log here: https://github.com/shawngraham/example-faillog-hist3814 
James Baker writes of failing here https://cradledincaricature.com/2017/06/29/dewizardification/ in his blog post "Dewizardification." 
Baker notes the importanace of telling stories, and how the "powers" of digial methods are not innate, but are instead based on hard 
work, failing repeatedly, asking people for help and compromise. He asks that we all try to make #dewizardification a thing, and spend 
more time telling our stories of failing with software, code and tech.
