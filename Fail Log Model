James Baker writes of failing here https://cradledincaricature.com/2017/06/29/dewizardification/ in his blog post "Dewizardification." Baker notes the importanace of telling stories, and how the "powers" of digial humanities are not innate, but are instead based on hard work and failing again and again.
